# XORING
# REVERSENGINEERING ..
# it is my last task
HOW I APPROACHED THE  Xoring TASK :
  FIRST i learned XOR ciphering uses XOR gate table to encrypt and decrypt the text using a key ,
  when anything  Xored with '0' gives same value, from this concept i verified  key as 'wired' ,
  i converted Hexa decimal values and Characters into into Binary form which are given in description and then 
  by using xor table ciphered the converted binary form key and converted values and decoded  values for ctf flag 
  and got flag ( wired { z3d_m4d3_th1s} )
  
 WHAT I LEARNED FROM IT :
  I studied XOR gate table 
  and converting the hexadecimal values to binary form and reverse 
  used xor table in ciphering two binary values 
  when a XOR a gives '0'
  when a XOR  0 gives 'a'
  xoring uses key to decrypt and encrypt
  

# I tried crypto tasks first in wired_ctf 
flag format ( wired{key} )
ceasercipher[CRYPTO]

HOW I APPROACHED IT :
  First i learned what is cipher and then identified the type of chipher as ceaserchipher,
  decoded the cipher text given in description using shifting the text words 
  
 WHAT I LEARNED FROM IT :
  I understood when we use ceaserciphering shifting 'a' by 1 shift gives
  'b'and by 2 gives  'c'
  
 # da_french_cipher-[CRYPTO]
 
 HOW I APPROACHED IT:
  I verified it is as vigenere cipher 
  and found online decoder to decrypt the cipher text using HINT a,e,i,o,u 
  and got the flag 
  
  WHAT I LEARNED FROM IT :
   I learned the vigener cipher uses table of alphabets to encrypt and decrypt using a key 
   table having series of alphabets in rows and columns the intersection of key and plain text words
   gives cipher text words , intersection of key and cipher text gives plain text .
   
 
 #Lifetimesettlement[CRYPTO]
  HOW I APPROACHED the task  :
   I identified it as spoon cipher and found a online compiler for decryption 
   of cipher text given description with 1s and 0s and got the flag 
   
   WHAT I LEARNED FROM IT :
    I learned that spoon ciphertext is encrypted in 0s and 1s
    which is represented instead of  sequence of characters 
    
  #GREP_IT[REVERSENGINEERING]
  HOW I APPROACHED THE TASK:
   Downloaded the file and  in linux termianl using grep command searched for 'wired'
   text and got the flag 
  WHAT I LEARNED FROM IT :
    linux command grep is used to extract or search text in a given file 
    
  #GREP-IT
  submitted flag again same description and flag .
  
  #DOZ3N_IS_K3Y[REVERSENGINEERING]
  HOW I APPROACHED THE TASK :
   Downloaded the file and in linux terminal using grep i searched for flag 
   i got cipher text and used online 
   compiler to decrypt the cipher text into plain text and got the flag 
  WHAT I LEARNED :
   again understood linux command grep can be  used to search for text in a file 
   
  #find_thyself[OSNIT]
  HOW I APPROACHED THE TASK:
   downloaded the file which have image from image identified a key word and searched for origin  keyword 
   got the country name italy 
  WHAT I LERANED:
   image have name of company which is famous in italy
   
  #Sanity Check-1[MISC]
   Jioned the discord  server and got the flag which is in discord
  
  #Sanity Check[MISC]
   Filled a given google form and got the flag 
  
  #Sanity check -2[MISC]
   Filled google form have same flag as before 
  
  #aint'_no_sunshine![OFFLINE HARDWARE]
  HOW I APPROACHED THE TASK:
   analysed the given circuit from description and joined the circuit 
   and connected the circuit to laptop runned the 
   circuit in aurdino and got flag 
  WHAT I LEARNED FROM TASK:
   understood the circuits connections 
   
  #Chans'favorite[WIRELESS]
  HOW I APPROACHED THE TASK:
   downloaded the software audacity as given hint and imported audio to audacity
   and using steganography settings
   got image and searched in google lens for name and got the flag 
  WHAT I LEARNED FROM IT :
    audacity software is used to convert audio to image using
    stegonography technique using steganography settings in audacity
